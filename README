There are a few differences to fgets(3):

1. Uses a context buffer type instead if *char
2. Returns *next_t instead of *char
3. Does not add \0 after the last character

The next_t struct contains the offset and the length to the next word.

- This saves the user to do strlen()
- Which saves the function to add \0

Demo:

1. Run make
2. Search a textfile, like rockyou.txt or even bigger
3. Compare

root@sf:~/fgets_sse2# cat rockyou.txt > /dev/null ## this should cache your dictionary in RAM

root@sf:~/fgets_sse2# time ./fgets_orig < rockyou.txt 

real    0m0.753s
user    0m0.724s
sys     0m0.028s

root@sf:~/fgets_sse2# time ./fgets_sse2 < rockyou.txt 

real    0m0.186s
user    0m0.140s
sys     0m0.044s

Proofes that this is ~4 times faster (thanks to SSE2) than glibc fgets(3) on Ubuntu 12.04.1 lts.

4. Check for "correctness" - uncomment demo2 in main.c and recompile:

root@sf:~/fgets_sse2# ./fgets_sse2 < rockyou.txt | md5sum
9076652d8ae75ce713e23ab09e10d9ee  -

root@sf:~/fgets_sse2# cat < rockyou.txt | md5sum
9076652d8ae75ce713e23ab09e10d9ee  -
